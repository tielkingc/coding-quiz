# Coding Quiz

## Purpose

This website uses JavaScript and HTML to create a quiz that a new developer can take to test their knowledge. The users will be prompted with a question, then given four answers that they must work through before time runs out. If they choose the correct answers their score will increase by 1, and if they choose a wrong answer the timer will go down and they will be prompted with the next question.

Once either all questions are answered or the timer runs out, the user will be presented with their score and will be asked to enter in their initials to save the score. Then a list of previous scores will show up.
